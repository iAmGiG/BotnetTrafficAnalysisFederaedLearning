    the federated computation is much to the input of the data, not as much as pulling data out of the process.
    this does not appear obvious as the @ may indicate some callable, but this is a strongly type solution to avoid
    path-ing in the traditional way.
    the main reason this appears to be done is to have the ability to just broadcast on the network to listening nodes.
    these nodes would then received a package from some server, and it has to be ready to retrieve the packages in a
    generic way.
    so we tell it what to possibly expect, rather than what to exactly expect
    this is why we see in the examples that the high level federated computation is a simple MVC style method, is that
    the other methods will be callable from within the code.
