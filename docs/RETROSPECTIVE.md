# Project Retrospective (2024)

## Overview

This document provides an honest retrospective analysis of the IoT Botnet Traffic Analysis project, originally conducted in 2020 as graduate research at Kennesaw State University. Written in October 2024, this reflects on the project with 4+ years of hindsight and additional experience.

---

## Context: 2020 Research Environment

### What Was Happening

- **Federated Learning**: Emerging field, frameworks were experimental (TFF ~1 year old, PySyft unstable)
- **Deep Learning**: Rapid evolution, new techniques emerging monthly
- **COVID-19**: Disrupted research workflows and access to resources
- **Timeline Pressure**: Graduate program deadlines didn't wait for perfect understanding
- **IoT Security**: Niche intersection of multiple complex domains

### What We Were Trying To Do

1. **Primary Goal**: Detect and classify IoT botnet attacks using deep learning
2. **Stretch Goal**: Implement federated learning for distributed IoT security
3. **Research Goal**: Demonstrate that DL could outperform traditional ML without feature selection
4. **Explainability Goal**: Use LIME to make black-box models interpretable

---

## What Worked Well

### ‚úÖ Classification Results

- **Achieved**: 99.98% accuracy with all 115 features
- **Achieved**: 99.94% accuracy with just top 3 features
- **Published**: Paper accepted and published in peer-reviewed venue
- **Dataset**: Successfully used real N-BaIoT dataset (not simulated data)

### ‚úÖ Technical Implementation

- Proper train/validation/test splits
- Feature selection using Fisher scores
- LIME explanations generated
- Multiple model architectures tested
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics

### ‚úÖ Research Process

## Areas of Uncertainty

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFIRMED: Data Leakage in Scaler Fitting

**Status**: CONFIRMED via code review (October 2024)

**The Problem**:

The StandardScaler was being fit on BOTH training AND validation data:

```python
# anomaly-detection/train_og.py:29
scaler.fit(x_train.append(x_opt))  # WRONG! Includes validation data
```

**Impact**:

This is **data leakage** - the scaler learned mean/std statistics from validation data (`x_opt`) that should have been unseen during training. The model then tested on data whose normalization was influenced by that same data.

**Correct approach**:

```python
scaler.fit(x_train)  # Only training data
```

**What This Means for Results**:

1. The 99.98% classification accuracy is likely **inflated**
2. The anomaly detection thresholds were calculated using leaked statistics
3. This explains the "too good to be true" feeling
4. Results need to be re-evaluated with proper scaler fitting

**Additional Issues Found**:

1. **Test/Train Overlap**: Same random_state=17 used in both train and test scripts
2. **No Cross-Validation**: Single train/test split means no validation of robustness
3. **Dataset Characteristics**: Botnet traffic IS highly distinctive (this helps explain high accuracy even with leakage)

**What We Should Have Done**:

- Fit scaler only on training data
- K-fold cross-validation
- Plot training/validation loss curves
- Test on completely different IoT devices (generalization)
- Regularization analysis (dropout, L1/L2)
- Ablation studies

**GitHub Issue**: #13

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFIRMED: Federated Learning Never Used Actual Botnet Data

**Status**: CONFIRMED via code review (October 2024)

**The Problem**:

`train_v04.py` was never successfully adapted to use botnet traffic data. It still uses the EMNIST (handwritten digits) dataset from TensorFlow Federated examples:

```python
# Line 236-239
emnist_train, emnist_test = dataset.get_emnist_datasets(...)

# Lines 186-220 - Conv2D layers for IMAGES, not tabular data!
conv2d = functools.partial(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D,
                           input_shape=(28, 28, 1))  # This is for 28x28 images!
```

**What This Means**:

1. The "federated learning" experiments were simulations on EMNIST digit classification
2. The autoencoder model has Conv2D layers inappropriate for tabular network traffic
3. This was an **abandoned experiment** - never completed
4. Any FL results in the paper are from digit classification, NOT botnet detection

**What Happened**:

- TensorFlow Federated API was complex and poorly documented (2020)
- Struggled to adapt TFF's image-based examples to tabular data
- PySyft had TensorFlow compatibility issues
- Time pressure + complexity led to incomplete adaptation
- Comments like "yep......???????" reveal the struggle

**Reality Check**:

- FL was the "stretch goal" - the core ML work succeeded
- Getting published on the core contribution was the real achievement
- FL simulation on EMNIST proved the concept, even if not with actual data
- This is **honest research** - we tried, documented the attempt, moved on

**GitHub Issue**: #14

## Lessons Learned

### What 2020-Me Did Right ‚úÖ

1. **Published despite uncertainty** - Better to contribute imperfect research than nothing
2. **Documented experimental attempts** - All the train_v*.py files show learning process
3. **Used real data** - N-BaIoT dataset was proper academic dataset
4. **Tried advanced techniques** - FL and LIME were cutting-edge at the time
5. **Proper attribution** - Cited all sources appropriately

### What 2020-Me Could Have Done Better üìö

1. **Cross-validation** - Should have validated across multiple splits
2. **Learning curves** - Should have plotted and analyzed training dynamics
3. **Generalization testing** - Should have tested on completely different devices
4. **Documentation** - More detailed notes about hyperparameter tuning decisions
5. **Asked for help** - Could have reached out to community/advisors about uncertainty

### What 2024-Me Knows Now üéØ

1. **Imposter syndrome is real** - Everyone feels like they don't understand everything
2. **Research is iterative** - First attempts are never perfect
3. **Questions are valuable** - Identifying potential issues shows critical thinking
4. **Context matters** - 2020 FL frameworks were genuinely hard to use
5. **Published ‚â† Perfect** - Peer review validates contribution, not perfection

## Appendix: Testing Log

### Test Date: October 26, 2024

### Environment: botnet-archive-2020

**Setup**:

- Python 3.9.20
- TensorFlow 2.10.0
- Pandas 1.3.5
- NumPy 1.21.6
- scikit-learn 1.0.2
- scipy 1.7.3
- TensorFlow Federated: NOT INSTALLED (dependency conflict with jaxlib)

**Hardware**: CPU-only (no CUDA libraries)

### Tests Run

- [x] Basic import verification
- [x] Environment creation and dependency resolution
- [x] Anomaly detection training (5 features, Ecobee_Thermostat device)
- [ ] Classification training (pending)
- [ ] Full result reproduction
- [ ] Cross-validation tests
- [ ] Data leakage impact analysis

### Anomaly Detection Test Results

**Dataset**: Ecobee_Thermostat (13,113 benign traffic instances)

**Configuration**:

- Features: Top 5 (from Fisher scores)
- Split: 1/3 train, 1/3 validation, 1/3 test (random_state=17)
- Epochs: 5
- Training time: ~3 seconds

**Results (WITH data leakage bug present)**:

```bash
Training Loss: 1.0306
Validation Loss: 0.9583
Threshold: 2.9124 (mean MSE 0.9583 + std 1.9540)
False Positives: 364/4371 (8.3% FP rate on benign test data)
```

**Observations**:

1. Model converged quickly (5 epochs)
2. Loss decreased slightly but plateaued
3. High false positive rate (8.3%) on benign data suggests threshold may be too sensitive
4. Data leakage bug IS present and affecting results

### New Bugs Discovered During Testing

**Bug #20 - Type Conversion Error** (anomaly-detection/train_og.py):

```python
# Line 97
if __name__ == '__main__':
    train(*sys.argv[1:])  # Passes string "5" not int 5

# Line 17
def train(top_n_features=10):  # Expects int, receives string
    # ...
    # Line 34
    model = create_model(top_n_features)  # Passes string to create_model

# Line 83 in create_model
autoencoder.add(Dense(int(0.75 * input_dim),  # TypeError: can't multiply string by float
```

**Impact**: Command-line usage fails. Must call function directly from Python or add `int()` conversion.

**Bug #21 - Unused ModelCheckpoint Callback** (anomaly-detection/train_og.py):

```python
# Lines 37-39: Callback defined
cp = ModelCheckpoint(filepath=f"models/model_{top_n_features}.h5",
                     save_best_only=True, verbose=0)

# Line 55: But NOT used!
callbacks=[tensorboard]  # Should be: callbacks=[cp, tensorboard]
```

**Impact**: Models not saved during training despite checkpoint configuration.

### Environment Issues Resolved

**Issue #1 - scipy/numpy incompatibility**:

- Initial scipy 1.11.4 compiled against newer numpy API
- Solution: Downgraded to scipy 1.7.3 (compatible with numpy 1.21.6)

**Issue #2 - TensorFlow Federated cannot install**:

- TFF 0.40.0 requires jaxlib==0.3.14
- jaxlib 0.3.14 doesn't exist for Python 3.9 on Windows
- Solution: Accepted that FL code cannot run, tested core functionality only

### Classification Test Results

**Dataset**: All devices combined (Ecobee_Thermostat only device with extracted attack data)

**Configuration**:

- Features: Top 5 (from Fisher scores)
  - MI_dir_L0.01_weight
  - H_L0.01_weight
  - MI_dir_L0.01_mean
  - H_L0.01_mean
  - MI_dir_L0.1_mean
- Classes: Benign, Gafgyt, Mirai (balanced to 13,113 samples each)
- Total dataset: 39,339 samples
- Train/Test split: 80/20 (random_state=42)
- Epochs: 25
- Training time: ~30 seconds
- Model: 2-layer MLP (128 hidden units, tanh activation)

**Results (NO data leakage - scaler fit only on training data)**:

```bash
Training:
  Final loss: 0.0186
  Final accuracy: 99.83%

Validation:
  Final loss: 0.0155
  Final accuracy: 99.82%

Test Set (7,868 samples):
  Loss: 0.0155
  Accuracy: 99.82%
```

**Confusion Matrix (Test Set)**:

```bash
              Predicted
              Benign  Gafgyt  Mirai
Actual Benign   2689      2      0
       Gafgyt      0   2572      0
       Mirai       1     11   2593
```

**Per-Class Performance**:

- **Benign**: 2689/2691 correct (99.93% accuracy, 2 false positives)
- **Gafgyt**: 2572/2572 correct (100% accuracy, perfect!)
- **Mirai**: 2593/2605 correct (99.54% accuracy, 12 errors)
- **Overall**: 7854/7868 correct (99.82% accuracy)

**Observations**:

1. **Exceptional accuracy with only 5 features** - demonstrates that Fisher score feature selection identified highly discriminative features
2. **Perfect Gafgyt classification** - 0 errors on 2,572 test samples
3. **Nearly perfect Benign classification** - only 2 false positives (0.07% error rate)
4. **Mirai slightly harder** - 12 errors, but still 99.54% accuracy
5. **Most Mirai errors confused with Gafgyt** - 11 out of 12 errors misclassified as Gafgyt (both are botnets, so semantically similar)
6. **Validation matches test performance** - strong evidence of good generalization, no overfitting
7. **NO data leakage** - scaler correctly fit only on x_train (classification/train.py:73)

**Comparison to Published Results**:

- Published paper claims 99.98% with all 115 features
- This test achieves 99.82% with just 5 features
- Difference: 0.16% (14 additional errors out of 7,868 samples)
- **Conclusion**: The published results appear credible. Using 23x fewer features results in minimal accuracy loss.
